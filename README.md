# Hodor

This Repo has various apps for the hodor project for Holberton School.  Each app
uses requests library from python to GET HTML from various pages at the URL:
`http://54.221.6.249/`.  Then, the apps POST data to a form that replicates a
voting poll.  My ID is 123 on all the forms, and the apps vote for my ID a
specific number of times accounting for various security measures.
